# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Python script which allows users to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

**How it Works**

The script imports the random module for generating computer choices.
ASCII art representations of rock, paper, and scissors are defined.
The user inputs their choice: 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors.
The script compares the user's choice with the computer's randomly generated choice.
It prints both choices using ASCII art.

It determines the winner based on the following rules:

   • Rock beats scissors.
   
   • Scissors beats paper.
   
   • Paper beats rock.
   
If both choices are the same, it's a draw.
The script prints the result of the game: whether the user wins, loses, or it's a draw.
